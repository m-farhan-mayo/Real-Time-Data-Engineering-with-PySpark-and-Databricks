# Real-Time-Data-Engineering-with-PySpark-and-Databricks


In this module, i have gain hands-on experience with PySpark and Databricks, focusing on real-time data processing and advanced data engineering concepts using Python.

We’ll start with a comprehensive Databricks Overview, followed by techniques for Incremental Data Loading and handling Schema Evolution in PySpark Streaming. You’ll learn how to manage Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCDs) and apply Window Functions using custom Python classes for advanced analytical operations.

The module also covers practical implementations such as Autoloader, Spark Streaming, and Delta Lake for reliable, scalable, and optimized real-time data pipelines. You’ll explore advanced topics including:

Conditional Columns and Parametrized Notebooks using Python loops

Managing Data Skewness for balanced workloads

Creating and managing Views and Global Views in Databricks

Implementing robust Error Handling mechanisms in PySpark

Leveraging Delta Tables for Streaming Pipelines

Understanding and using Deletion Vectors for efficient data updates and deletes

You’ll also dive into Spark Optimization techniques to enhance performance and ensure efficient resource utilization.
